# Complete Placement Preparation Repository

This repository is a comprehensive guide to ace technical interviews for `SDE`, `Machine Learning`, `Data Science`, and other computer science roles. It includes my personal notes, solved questions, and curated resources for every core subject asked in placements.

Each directory in this repository contains detailed notes and commonly asked interview questions from that particular subject area. Alongside notes, I am also maintaining solved problem statements (where applicable), brief explanations of core concepts, dry runs of important DSA problems, and links to further resources. Many of the questions are compiled from previous company-specific interviews and popular coding platforms.

This repository is intended to be a living document. As I continue to learn and revise, I will keep updating the content to reflect a more refined understanding of each topic. The goal is not only to prepare for interviews but also to build a strong foundational grasp of each subject.

## Current Structure

- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Includes pattern-based problems, solution walkthroughs, and core algorithm concepts.

- **OOPs**: Covers principles of Object-Oriented Programming, design patterns, and practical implementation examples.

- **DBMS**: Covers relational models, indexing, normalization, SQL queries, transactions, concurrency, and more.

- **Operating Systems**: Includes process scheduling, memory management, threads, synchronization, and virtual memory, and more.

- **System Design**: Contains foundational concepts of low-level and high-level design, system architecture, and design problems.

- **Aptitude and Reasoning**: Common numerical, logical, and verbal aptitude problems often seen in preliminary rounds.

- **HR and Behavioral Questions**: STAR-format answers, resume-based questions, and commonly asked behavioral rounds.

## Maintenance Plan

To ensure this repository stays organized and current, I have structured it for consistent weekly updates. Each folder has its own `README.md` to serve as an index for quick navigation. I aim to add 3â€“5 questions or summaries each week, sourced from mock interviews, online contests, company-specific interview discussions, or reading material. As new subjects emerge during my preparation, I will expand the repository accordingly.

This project also serves as a self-evaluation tool where I revisit topics in intervals, track mistakes, and refine explanations over time. For theoretical sections, I maintain concise write-ups followed by deeper elaboration where required. For coding-related areas, the focus is on patterns, dry runs, edge case analysis, and clean implementation.
