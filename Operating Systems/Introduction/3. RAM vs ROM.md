# RAM vs ROM

**Memory** is an important part of the Computer which is responsible for storing data and information on a temporary or permanent basis. Memory can be classified into two broad categories:

- **Primary Memory**: This is the main memory of the computer, which is directly accessible by the CPU. It is used to store data and instructions that are currently being used by the CPU. Primary memory is further divided into two types: `RAM and ROM`.

- **Secondary Memory**: This is the non-volatile memory of the computer, which is used to store data and instructions that are not currently being used by the CPU. Examples of secondary memory include `hard drives`, `solid-state drives`, and `optical discs`.

## Definition

- **RAM (Random Access Memory):**  
    - RAM is a type of volatile memory that is used to store data and instructions that are currently being used by the CPU. 
    
    - It is called "random access" because the CPU can access any location in the memory directly, without having to go through other locations first. 
    
    - RAM is used for temporary storage and is cleared when the computer is turned off.

- **ROM (Read-Only Memory):**
    
    - ROM is a type of non-volatile memory that is used to store data and instructions that are permanently stored in the memory. 
    
    - It is called "read-only" because the data stored in ROM cannot be modified or deleted by the user. 
    
    - ROM is used to store firmware, which is a type of software that is permanently stored in the memory and is used to control the basic functions of the computer.

## Key Differences

| Feature            | RAM                                             | ROM                                             |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Nature**         | Volatile – data is lost when power is off.       | Non-volatile – data remains even without power. |
| **Usage**          | Temporary storage for programs and active data.  | Permanent storage for firmware/BIOS.            |
| **Read/Write**     | Both read and write operations allowed.          | Mostly read-only; writing is restricted.        |
| **Speed**          | Much faster (measured in nanoseconds).           | Slower compared to RAM.                         |
| **Capacity**       | Larger (GBs in modern systems).                  | Smaller (a few MBs for firmware).               |
| **Example**        | System memory used for running apps.             | BIOS chip on the motherboard.                   |

## Types of RAM

### 1. Static RAM (SRAM)

- **Definition:** Stores data in **flip-flops**; retains data as long as power is supplied.

- **Speed:** Faster than DRAM because it doesn’t need refreshing.

- **Cost:** More expensive.

- **Use Case:** CPU cache, high-speed registers.

### 2. Dynamic RAM (DRAM)

- **Definition:** Stores data in **capacitors** which must be refreshed thousands of times per second.

- **Speed:** Slower than SRAM.

- **Cost:** Cheaper and higher density.

- **Use Case:** Main memory in desktops and laptops.

| Feature        | SRAM                          | DRAM                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Storage**    | Flip-flops                     | Capacitors                        |
| **Refresh**    | Not required                   | Required periodically             |
| **Speed**      | Faster                         | Slower                             |
| **Cost**       | Expensive                      | Cheaper                             |
| **Application**| Cache memory                    | Main memory                         |

## Types of ROM

### 1. PROM (Programmable ROM)

- **Definition:** Blank ROM that can be **programmed once** by the user using a special device.

- **Use Case:** Storing permanent data like device configuration.

### 2. EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)

- **Definition:** Can be **erased by ultraviolet (UV) light** and reprogrammed.

- **Use Case:** Prototyping and firmware development.

### 3. EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM)

- **Definition:** Can be **erased and reprogrammed electrically**, byte by byte.

- **Use Case:** BIOS updates, embedded system storage.
